'''
This is your first task in your new job.
You were tasked to create a list of the stock in a bakery and you really don't want to fail at you first day at work.
You will receive a single line containing some food (keys) and quantities (values).
They will be separated by a single space (the first element is the key, the second â€“ the value and so on).
Create a dictionary with all the keys and values and print it on the console

def bakery(ingredients):
    bake = ingredients.split(' ')
    bakery = {}

    for b in range(0, len(bake), 2):
        key = bake[b]
        value = bake[b + 1]
        bakery[key] = int(value)

    print(bakery)

bakery(input())
