'''
The Album class should receive a name (string) upon initialization and might receive one or more songs. It also has instance attributes: published (False by default) and songs (an empty list). It has four methods:
-	add_song(song: Song)
o	Adds the song to the album and returns "Song {song_name} has been added to the album {name}."
o	If the song is single, returns "Cannot add {song_name}. It's a single"
o	If the album is published, returns "Cannot add songs. Album is published."
o	If the song is already added, return "Song is already in the album."
-	remove_song(song_name: str)
o	Removes the song with the given name and returns "Removed song {song_name} from album {album_name}."
o	If the song is not in the album, returns "Song is not in the album."
o	If the album is published, returns "Cannot remove songs. Album is published."

-	publish()
o	Publishes the album (set to True) and returns "Album {name} has been published."
o	If the album is published, returns "Album {name} is already published."
-	details()
o	Returns the information of the album, with the songs in it, in the format:
"Album {name}
 == {first_song_info}
 == {second_song_info}
 â€¦
 == {n_song_info}"
