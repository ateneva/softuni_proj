### OOP principles
* relies on the concept of classes and objects
* a class is used to create individual instance of an object

### Advantages of OOP
* provides a clear program structure **and a clean code**
* **reduces complexity**
* makes it easy to **write re-usable code**
* could test each behaviour of an object separately
* facilitates **easy maintenance and modification** of existing code


### Rules of thumb: 
* **Splitting code into functions and classes:** 
  * improves readability
  * allows for easier debugging

‼️ A single class method should complete a single task

‼️ The class method should clearly state what it does

✅ By giving relevant names to functions and classes, you ensure self-documenting code



### What is the difference between a class and a function?

‼️ The difference between a function and a class is that 
* **the class retains a `state` for itself** 
* and every class execution may be different depending on the `state`

* `state`
  * helps to distinguish an object from other objects
    * a phone could have `colour`, `size` and `weight`

* `behaviour`
  * the tasks that an object performs
    * a phone could turn on or off

```python
class Phone:
    # state
    def __init__(self, color, size):
        self.color = color
        self.size = size

    # behaviour
    def turn_on(self):
        return 'The phone is turned on'
```

### What are classes?:
Classes create new types of objects that allow instances of that type to be made:
* ✅ Classes allows us to **create objects that follow a certain template**
  * 💡 List is a class, Set is a class

* ➡️ Class attributes **preserve the state** 🔻
  * i.e. each class instance can have attributes for maintaining its state
  * class instance can also have methods for modifying its state

### What is an instance?
* specific realization of an object of a certain class
* The creation of an instance is called `instantiation`

```python
class Laptop:
    def __init__(self, name, model):    # class method
        self.name = name
        self.model = model              # instance attribute

my_laptop = Laptop("Inspiron 15", "Dell")
```
  * `self` is used to represent the instance of a class
  * `self` ⚠️ self must always be given as the first parameter  
  * `self` ➡️ self enables the class to access its own state
  * `self` binds the attributes with the given arguments


**Problem: Class Book**
* create a class called `Book`
* Upon initialization it should receive:
  * `name`
  * `author`
  * `pages`

* **a Class can call another class**

```python
class Author:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name


class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, pages):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.pages = pages

    def open(self):
        print(f'Opening the book {self.title} with author {self.author.first_name}')

    def close(self):
        pass

author = Author("Jay", "Shetty")      # create an object based on the class
book = Book("My Book", author, 200)   
print(book.title)
print(book.author)
print(book.pages)
print(book.author.first_name)
print(book.author.last_name)
print(book.open())
```


### Class Methods: 
* we define the behaviour of an object using `methods`
* A method is a `function` that works only within a `class`

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def sleep(self):
        return "sleeping.."

animal = Animal("cat")  # create an object based on the class
print(animal.sleep())   # sleeping...
```

### Using a Class
* this means creating new instances of an object and executing operation on the instances
  * **Each object** that was created based on a given class **will have a unique id**

```python
class Person():
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def eat(self):
        return 'eating...'

person = Person()   # create an object based on the class
print(person.eat()) # eating...
```

### Problems: 
###### Car
* create a class `Car` that receives: `name`, `model`, `engine` upon initialization
* it should have a method called `get_info()` which returns `This is {name} {model} with engine {engine}`

https://github.com/ateneva/softuni_proj/blob/main/3_OOP/01_defining_classes/ex_01_car.py

###### Music
* create a class `Music` that receives `title`, `artist` and `lyrics` upon initialization
* it should have 2 methods: 
  * `print_info()` - returns `This is {title} from {artist}`
  * `play()` - returns the lyrics

https://github.com/ateneva/softuni_proj/blob/main/3_OOP/01_defining_classes/04_music.py

### Data classes - as of Python 3.7
* a data class comes with basic functionality that has already been implemented

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class DataClassCard:
    rank: str
    suit: str
```
VS.

```python
class RegularCard:
    def __init__(self, rank, suit):
        self.rank = rank
        self.suit = suit
```

* add default values for your Data Class  

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Position:
    name: str
    lon: float = 0.0
    lat: float = 0.0
```

* add methods to your data class

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from math import asin, cos, radians, sin, sqrt

@dataclass
class Position:
    name: str
    lon: float = 0.0
    lat: float = 0.0

    def distance_to(self, other):
        r = 6371  # Earth radius in kilometers
        lam_1, lam_2 = radians(self.lon), radians(other.lon)
        phi_1, phi_2 = radians(self.lat), radians(other.lat)
        h = (sin((phi_2 - phi_1) / 2)**2
             + cos(phi_1) * cos(phi_2) * sin((lam_2 - lam_1) / 2)**2)
        return 2 * r * asin(sqrt(h))
```

### Scope & Namespace
* built-in names for example `abs()` function
  * global names in module
    * local names on function invocation
    
**What is a scope?** 
* A region in a program where a namespace is directly accessible
  * innermost scope is searched first
    * the scopes of any enclosing fuctions
      * module's global names
        * built-in names


```python
def scopes():
    def local_scope():      # local scope
        text = "local text"

    def nonlocal_scope():   # non-local scope
        nonlocal text 
        text = "nonlocal text"

    def global_scope():
        global text
        text = "global text"
```

**Problem: Scope Mess**
* Fix the provided code, so that it prints the result as expected
```
expected output:
global 
outer: local
inner: nonlocal
outer: nonlocal
global: changed!
```

```python
def outer():
    x = "local"

    def inner():
        x = "nonlocal"
        print("inner:", x)

    def change_global():
        x = "global: changed!"

    print("outer:", x)
    inner()
    print("outer:", x)
    change_global()

print(x)
outer()
print(x)
```

⬆️ code above is confusing and unreadable and difficult to track the variable change

‼️ **Avoid using global and nonlocal like that**

⬇️ neater solution

```python
x = "global"

def outer():
    def inner():
        new_x = f"nonlocal{x}"
        print("inner:", new_x)
        return new_x

    def change_global():
        return "global: changed!"

    x = "local"
    print("outer:", x)
    x = inner()
    print("outer:", x)
    return change_global()


print(x)
x = outer()
print(x)
```

## The Class Object:
* support two kinds of operations: 
  * attribute references
    * uses standard syntax
    * valid attribute names are the ones in the class namespace

```python
class MyClass:
    "A sample example class"
    i = 12345
    
    def f(self):
        return 'hello world'
```

  * instantiation
    * creates a new instance of the class and assigns this object to the local variable `x`
    * the instantiation creates an empty object
    * many classes create objects with instances customized to a specific initial state
    * therefore a class may define a special method `__init__()`

```python
class Music:
    def __init__(self, title, artist, lyrics):
        self.title = title
        self.artist = artist
        self.lyrics = lyrics

    # method
    def print_info(self):
        return f'This is "{self.title}" from "{self.artist}"'

    # method
    def play(self):
        return self.lyrics


song = Music("Title", "Artist", "Lyrics")
print(song.print_info())
print(song.play())
```

In this guide, you'll look at Python type checking. Traditionally, types have been handled by the Python interpreter in a flexible but implicit way. Recent versions of Python allow you to specify explicit type hints that can be used by different tools to help you develop your code more efficiently.
