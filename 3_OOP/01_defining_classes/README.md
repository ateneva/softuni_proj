## Advantages of OOP

- provides a clear program structure **and a clean code**

* **reduces code complexity and improves readability**

* easier to maintain (i.e. a change only needs to be made at one place)

* **makes it easier to debug**

* code is **re-usable**

* could test each behaviour of an object separately

---

## Rules of thumb

* **Splitting code into functions and classes:**

  * improves readability
  * allows for easier debugging

* **A single class method should complete a single task**

```python

# bad practice
do_magic ( ‚Ä¶ )
deposit_or_withdraw ( ‚Ä¶ )
deposit_and_get_balance ( ‚Ä¶ )
parse_data_and_return_result ( ‚Ä¶ )

# best practice
withdraw ( ‚Ä¶ )
deposit ( ‚Ä¶ )
getBalance ( ‚Ä¶ )
toString ( ‚Ä¶ )
```

**The class method should clearly state what it does**

‚úÖ By giving relevant names to functions and classes, you ensure self-documenting code

---

## What is the difference between a class and a function?

* **the class retains a `state` for itself**
* and every class execution may be different depending on the `state`

* `state`
  * helps to distinguish an object from other objects
    * a phone could have `colour`, `size` and `weight`

* `behaviour`
  * the tasks that an object performs
    * a phone could turn on or off

```python
class Phone:
    # state
    def __init__(self, color, size):
        self.color = color
        self.size = size

    # behaviour
    def turn_on(self):
        return 'The phone is turned on'
```

## What are classes?

Classes provide means of building data functionality together

* ‚úÖ Classes allows us to **create objects that follow a certain template**
  * üí° List is a class, Set is a class

* ‚û°Ô∏è Class attributes **preserve the state** üîª
  * i.e. each class instance can have attributes for maintaining its state

  * class instance can also have methods for modifying its state

### What is an instance?

* specific realization of an object of a certain class

* The creation of an instance is called `instantiation`

  * i.e. when a class defines an `__init__()` method, this method is invoked for the newly-created class instance

```python
class Laptop:
    def __init__(self, name, model):    # class method
        self.name = name
        self.model = model              # instance attribute

my_laptop = Laptop("Inspiron 15", "Dell")
```

* `self` is used to represent the instance of a class
* `self` must always be given as the first parameter 
* `self` preserves the state of the object 
* `self` enables the class to access its own state
* `self` binds the attributes with the given arguments

```python
# example 
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        print(f'Init method for person {name}')
        self.name = name
        print(self)

    def say_hello(self):
        print(f'{self.name} says "Hello"')

p = Person('Pesho')
print(p.name)
p.say_hello()

g = Person('Gosho')
print(g.name)
g.say_hello()
```

```text
Init method for person Pesho
<__main__.Person object at 0x102835ac0>
Pesho
Pesho says "Hello"
Init method for person Gosho
<__main__.Person object at 0x102a8a460>
Gosho
Gosho says "Hello"
```

#### Problem: Class Book

* create a class called `Book`
* Upon initialization it should receive:
  * `name`
  * `author`
  * `pages`

* **a Class can call another class**

```python
class Author:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name


class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, pages):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.pages = pages

    def open(self):
        print(f'Opening the book {self.title} with author {self.author.first_name}')

    def close(self):
        pass

author = Author("Jay", "Shetty")      # create an object based on the class
book = Book("My Book", author, 200)   
print(book.title)
print(book.author)
print(book.pages)
print(book.author.first_name)
print(book.author.last_name)
print(book.open())
```

### Class Methods

* we define the behaviour of an object using `methods`
* A method is a `function` that works only within a `class`

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    
    def sleep(self):
        return "sleeping.."

animal = Animal("cat")  # create an object based on the class
print(animal.sleep())   # sleeping...
```

### Using a Class

* this means creating new instances of an object and executing operation on the instances
  * **Each object** that was created based on a given class **will have a unique id**

```python
class Person():
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def eat(self):
        return 'eating...'

person = Person('Angelina', 35)

print( f'{person.name} is {person.eat()}')

# Angelina is eating...
```

### Problems

###### Car

* create a class `Car` that receives: `name`, `model`, `engine` upon initialization
* it should have a method called `get_info()` which returns `This is {name} {model} with engine {engine}`

<https://github.com/ateneva/softuni_proj/blob/main/3_OOP/01_defining_classes/ex_01_car.py>

###### Music

* create a class `Music` that receives `title`, `artist` and `lyrics` upon initialization
* it should have 2 methods:
  * `print_info()` - returns `This is {title} from {artist}`
  * `play()` - returns the lyrics

<https://github.com/ateneva/softuni_proj/blob/main/3_OOP/01_defining_classes/04_music.py>

### Data classes - as of Python 3.7

* a data class comes with basic functionality that has already been implemented

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class DataClassCard:
    rank: str
    suit: str
```

VS.

```python
class RegularCard:
    def __init__(self, rank, suit):
        self.rank = rank
        self.suit = suit
```

* add default values for your Data Class  

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Position:
    name: str
    lon: float = 0.0
    lat: float = 0.0
```

* add methods to your data class

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from math import asin, cos, radians, sin, sqrt

@dataclass
class Position:
    name: str
    lon: float = 0.0
    lat: float = 0.0

    def distance_to(self, other):
        r = 6371  # Earth radius in kilometers
        lam_1, lam_2 = radians(self.lon), radians(other.lon)
        phi_1, phi_2 = radians(self.lat), radians(other.lat)
        h = (sin((phi_2 - phi_1) / 2)**2
             + cos(phi_1) * cos(phi_2) * sin((lam_2 - lam_1) / 2)**2)
        return 2 * r * asin(sqrt(h))


oslo = Position('Oslo', 10.8, 59.9)
vancouver = Position('Vancouver', -123.1, 49.3)
print(oslo.distance_to(vancouver)) #7181.7841229421165
```

### Scope & Namespace

* built-in names for example `abs()` function
  * global names in module
    * local names on function invocation

**What is a scope?**

* A region in a program where a namespace is directly accessible
  * innermost scope is searched first
    * the scopes of any enclosing functions
      * module's global names
        * built-in names

```python
def scopes():
    def local_scope():      # local scope
        text = "local text"

    def nonlocal_scope():   # non-local scope
        nonlocal text
        text = "nonlocal text"

    def global_scope():
        global text
        text = "global text"

    text = "Initial"
    print(text)

    local_scope()
    print(text)

    nonlocal_scope()
    print(text)

    global_scope()
    print(text)

scopes()
print(text)
```

```text
Initial
Initial
nonlocal text
nonlocal text
global text
```

**Problem: Scope Mess**

* Fix the provided code, so that it prints the result as expected

```
expected output:
global 
outer: local
inner: nonlocal
outer: nonlocal
global: changed!
```

```python
def outer():
    x = "local"

    def inner():
        x = "nonlocal"
        print("inner:", x)

    def change_global():
        x = "global: changed!"

    print("outer:", x)
    inner()
    print("outer:", x)
    change_global()

print(x)
outer()
print(x)
```

‚¨ÜÔ∏è code above is confusing and unreadable and difficult to track the variable change

‚ÄºÔ∏è **Avoid using global and nonlocal**
* global variables are difficult ot track

‚¨áÔ∏è neater solution

```python
x = "global"

def outer():
    def inner():
        new_x = f"nonlocal{x}"
        print("inner:", new_x)
        return new_x

    def change_global():
        return "global: changed!"

    x = "local"
    print("outer:", x)
    x = inner()
    print("outer:", x)
    return change_global()


print(x)
x = outer()
print(x)
```

## The Class Object

* support two kinds of operations:
  * attribute references
    * uses standard syntax
    * valid attribute names are the ones in the class namespace

```python
class MyClass:
    "A sample example class"
    i = 12345
    
    def f(self):
        return 'hello world'
```

* instantiation
  * creates a new instance of the class and assigns this object to the local variable `x`
  * the instantiation creates an empty object
  * many classes create objects with instances customized to a specific initial state
  * therefore a class may define a special method `__init__()`

```python
class Music:
    def __init__(self, title, artist, lyrics):
        self.title = title
        self.artist = artist
        self.lyrics = lyrics

    # method
    def print_info(self):
        return f'This is "{self.title}" from "{self.artist}"'

    # method
    def play(self):
        return self.lyrics

song = Music("Title", "Artist", "Lyrics")
print(song.print_info())
print(song.play())
```
