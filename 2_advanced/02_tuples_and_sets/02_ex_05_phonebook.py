# ----------------------problem 5: phonebook -----------------------------------

'''
Write a program that receives info from the console about people and their phone numbers.
You are free to choose the way the data is entered; each entry should have
    a name and a number (both strings).
    If you receive a name that already exists in the phonebook, update its number.
After filling the phonebook, you will receive a number â€“ N.
Your program should be able to perform a search of a contact by name
    and print her details in format "{name} -> {number}".
In case the contact isn't found, print "Contact {name} does not exist."

    if len(entries) > 1:
        record = {phones[0]: phones[1] for phone in phones}
        phonebook.update(record)
