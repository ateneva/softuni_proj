### Tuples: 
* sequences of **immutable** objects

```python
# creating a tuple 
t = (1,2,3)
print(t[0])

# creating a tuple with a single element
t = (1, )
```

### Tuple Methods
There are only 2 tuple methods

| Method | Description |
| ---| --- |
| [count()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_tuple_count.asp) | Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple |
| [index()](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_tuple_index.asp) | Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found |

```python
numbers = (1,2,1,3,1)
numbers.count(1) # 3
```

```python
names = ("Pesho", "Gosho", "Gosho")
names.index("Gosho") # 1
```

**Problem: Count same values**
* _You will be given floating point numbers separated by a space_
* _Count the occurences of each value and print it_

```python
# count the same values
sequence = tuple([float(s) for s in input().split(" ")])
occurences = {}

for s in sequence:
    if s not in occurences:
        occurences[s] = 0
    occurences[s] += 1

for k, v in occurences.items():
    print(f'{k} - {v} times')
```


### Tuple unpacking
* Tuple unpacking extracts the tuple elements and assigns them

```python
data = (1,2,3)
x, y, z = data

print(x)  # 1
print(y)  # 2
print(z)  # 3
```

### the SET method
* You can use the set method to extract only unique elements from a list
* the **SET** method returns a set with UNIQUE values

```python
numbers = [1,2,2,3,1,4,5,4]
unique_numbers = list(set(numbers)) # [1,2,3,4,5
```

### SET
* unordered collection of items
* each set element is unique
* SETS are **mutable**, so we can add or remove elements
  
### Set Operators
```python
a = set([1,2,3,4])
b = set([3,4,5,6])

print(a - b)  # find members that are in a but not in b
print(a | b)  # find the members that are in either a or b
print(a ^ b)  # find the members that are not in both
print(a & b)  # find the members that are in both
```

### Set Methods
```python
a = set([1,2,3,4])
b = set([3,4,5,6])

print(a.union(b))                 # equivalent to a | b
print(a.intersection(b))          # equivalent to a & b
print(a.issubset(b))              # equivalent to a <= b
print(a.issuperset(b))            # equivalent to a >= b
print(a.difference(b))            # equivalent to a - b
print(a.symmetric_difference(b))  # equivalent to a ^ b
```

**Problem: Unique Names**
* You will be given a list and you have to print unique items
  * the order does not matter

```python
# create a non-empty set
n = int(input())
names = {input() for _ in range(n)}
[print(name) for name in names]

# approach 2 ->  create an empty set and add values to it
n = int(input())
unique_names = set()

for i in range(n):
    unique_names.add(input())

for person in unique_names:
    print(person)
```

```python
num_cars = int(input())
parking = set()

for c in range(1, num_cars + 1):
    # car = input().split(", ")
    # direction = car[0]
    # car_plate = car[1]
    (direction, car_plate) = input().split(", ")
  
    if direction == 'IN':
        parking.add(car_plate)
    else:
        parking.remove(car_plate)

if len(parking) > 0:
    [print(p) for p in parking]
else:
    print("Parking Lot is Empty")
```
